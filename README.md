# VBA-challenge

Module 2 Challenge

vba_challenge.bas analyzes data from 'Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm' using the VBA scripting program. The program outputs columns summarizing each stocks yearly change, percent change, and the total stock volume. It also displays the stocks that have the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume, along with the numerical values associated with them.

Installation: Need to have Microsoft Excel with the developer tab enabled.

To run vba_challenge.bas, you need to create a VBA module in the 'Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm' and copy the text from vba_challenge.bas into the module.
Once text is copied, you should just be able to run the script to analyze the data. 

Note: vba_challenge.bas will also work with 'alphabetical_testing.xlsm'

Note: Make sure that the Excel file that you are using has macros enabled (should be a .xlsm file).
